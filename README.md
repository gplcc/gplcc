# GPLv2-Cure-Commitment

At the end of November 2017 Red Hat along with IBM, Google and Facebook announced that we were adopting the GPLv3 cure provisions for our GPLv2 licensed code.  Here is a link to the press release [link](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/technology-industry-leaders-join-forces-increase-predictability-open-source-licensing). In March 2018, CA Technologies, Cisco, HPE, Microsoft, SAP and SUSE also made that commitment. This was the same approach that was adopted in October by the Linux Foundation  Technical Advisory Board and many Linux kernel developers. It is also one of the Principles of Community-Oriented Enforcement adopted by the Software Freedom Conservancy and the FSF.  

We extended these rights because we believe it is good and right for the community. These rights will provide additional comfort that users of GPLv2, LGPLv2.1 and LGPL v2 code have reasonable assurances that they can use that code,  even if there is an inadvertent and temporary noncompliance with the license due to ambiguity, misunderstanding or otherwise. These rights will also help reduce the opportunity for copyright trolling.

### GPLv2 Cure Commitment - For Individuals

Solely for any software for which I personally own copyright that is licensed under a Covered License, before filing or continuing to prosecute any legal proceeding or claim (other than a Defensive Action) arising from termination of a Covered License, I commit to extend to the person or entity (“you”) accused of violating the Covered License the following provisions regarding cure and reinstatement, taken from GPL version 3. As used here, the term ‘this License’ refers to the specific Covered License being enforced.

“However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
	 	
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.”

I intend   this Commitment to be irrevocable, and binding and enforceable against me and assignees of or successors to my copyrights.


Definitions:

‘Covered License’ means the GNU General Public License, version 2 (GPLv2), the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 (LGPLv2.1), or the GNU Library General Public License, version 2 (LGPLv2), all as published by the Free Software Foundation.

‘Defensive Action’ means a legal proceeding or claim that Red Hat brings against you in response to a prior proceeding or claim initiated by you or your affiliate.
