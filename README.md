# GPLv2-Cure-Commitment

At the end of November 2017 Red Hat along with IBM, Google and Facebook announced that we were adopting the GPLv3 cure provisions for our GPLv2 licensed code. Here is a link to the press release [link](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/technology-industry-leaders-join-forces-increase-predictability-open-source-licensing). In March 2018, CA Technologies, Cisco, HPE, Microsoft, SAP and SUSE also made that commitment. This was the same approach that was adopted in October by the Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board and many Linux kernel developers. It is also one of the Principles of Community-Oriented Enforcement adopted by the Software Freedom Conservancy and the FSF.

We extended these rights because we believe it is good and right for the community. These rights will provide additional comfort that users of GPLv2, LGPLv2.1 and LGPL v2 code have reasonable assurances that they can use that code, even if there is an inadvertent and temporary noncompliance with the license due to ambiguity, misunderstanding or otherwise. These rights will also help reduce the opportunity for copyright trolling.
